Install project step by step from scratch

- Download and install git from git-scm.com
- Select a folder (name of it e.g.: "zmhb") where you want to work in
- In your "zmbh" folder right click and click to "Open Git Bash here"
- Configure git with your username and email:
	~ git config --global user.name "YOUR_NAME"
	~ git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"
- Create an SSH and connect it to Github to get the project with
	~ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
	~ Move to the folder where is it ( ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub )
	~ Copy the SSH without your email address
	~ Open Github and go to the settings:
		> Click to SSH and GPG keys
		> New SSH key
		> Paste your pub SSH without your email address and save it
		> Now you will able to clone your repository with ssh cloning
		> Select the "<> Code" button on zmbh repository and copy the path below SSH tab
- Clone your repository
	~ After copied your SSH path just paste it to your Git Bash in the selected folder
	~ git clone git@github.com:mzoli95/zmbh.git
	~ You have cloned the repository successfully
- Download or upgrade your Node.js from nodejs.org ( I recommend the LTS one ) and install it
- Download or upgrade your Visual Studio Code (VSCode) from code.visualstudio.com and install it
- Install or update your Angular version if it's needed
	~ npm install -g @angular/cli
	~ If it's needed you can update your npm as well with this command: npm install -g npm@latest
	
	(NOT NEEDED, just good to know it)
		// ~ If you want to create a new project: ng new "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME"
	 	In case you got an error after this command (ng : File C:\Users\zoli1\AppData\Roaming\npm\ng.ps1 		cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.):
		> Write this command: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
		//
	
- After installed the programs before I recommend you to restart your computer
- Open the zmbh repository
	~ Open VSCode:
		> Select "Open folder" and search the folder where you cloned your repository and open it
		> Click to the "Terminal" tab and click to the "New Terminal" option
		> In the bottom of VSCode you will get a new terminal where you have to make sure you are in the correct folder path
- With "npm start" you can start the project (LATER NEEDS TO UPDATE THIS COMMAND)


- About node server
	Create an empty directory, run cmd and put npm init. Create a server.js or something name file and you can start to work on it via vscode
